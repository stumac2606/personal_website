# Project: Personal Website (Stuart)

## Goal
Build a fast, professional personal website using Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind.
Priorities: clean layout, strong typography, great mobile responsiveness, fast load, SEO.

## Style rules
- Use Tailwind for styling (minimal custom CSS).
- Prefer simple, readable components over complex abstractions.
- Use accessible HTML (labels, alt text, semantic tags).
- Keep pages lightweight; optimize images with next/image.
- No placeholder “AI-ish” gradients unless explicitly asked.

## Content sections (initial)
- Home: hero + short intro + featured projects
- About: bio + timeline
- Work/Projects: cards with tags + case-study pages
- Media: embedded video(s) and image gallery
- Contact: email + socials

## Commands
- Dev: npm run dev
- Lint: npm run lint
- Build: npm run build
- Start: npm run start

## Definition of done
- All pages responsive
- Lighthouse-style basics: good headings, metadata, open graph
- Clean navigation + footer

## Default UI skill
- For any frontend pages, layouts, or components, ALWAYS use the `frontend-design` skill.
- Prioritise distinctive, intentional aesthetics over generic layouts.
- Avoid default fonts, default colour palettes, and predictable component patterns.

## Brand direction (must follow)
- Positioning: athlete + technologist + snowboard instructor; bridges performance + engineering.
- Aesthetic: “Kinetic Editorial” — magazine typography, confident whitespace, subtle athletic telemetry motifs.
- Avoid: startup gradients, template bento blocks, generic component libraries, default fonts, “AI-looking” layouts.
- Feel: authored, premium, human, slightly gritty (sport), but precise (tech).

## Skill usage
- Use `frontend-design` for all UI and aesthetic decisions.
- After major UI changes, use `web-design-reviewer` to fix layout, responsiveness, and accessibility.
